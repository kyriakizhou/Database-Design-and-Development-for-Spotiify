# Database-Design-and-Development-for-Spotiify
This is the project for 67272 Database Design and Development @ Carnegie Mellon University. 
I collaborated with Rohit Kumar in this project; and I am mainly in charge of defining user stories, relational model, and setting up backend code for analyzing data by writing PostgreSQL query and python code. 

Set up the "Spotify" database
% psql -d spotify -U isdb -f initialize.sql

Run show_all.sql to load all data
% psql -d spotify -U isdb -f show_all.sql
